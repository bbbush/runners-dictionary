- Yasso format
  Predict marathon time with 800m repetitions. Each repetition should take the same time. Runner should strive for the fastest pace that is sustainable, so the first repetition should not be too fast. In one CARA training, the time for group II was 3:15 and rest time was 2:40, for 10 repetitions; the time was quite consistent (+/- 10s)
