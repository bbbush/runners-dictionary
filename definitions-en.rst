Marathon
  26.22mi or 42.195km. A dumb runners would say "I just finished 5K marathon," but that is a misuse of the term.

Pace
  There are two ways to represent pace: the minutes per mile, or the reciprocal, the miles per hour. Unlike MPG (miles per gallon), where the fuel efficiency can be directly compared, many people prefer the minutes per mile measure. A treadmill usually allows the runner to choose between them.

  In CARA training plan, there are several different types of runs, and the pace of each is related to the goal pace. Runners have very different understanding to pace terms due to indiviual goals and conditions. Weather (temperature, humidity, wind, rain or snow) can severely affect performance. Thus when looking at the pace number for a certain run, one has to combine all the information to understand what type of run it is. Typically there is one TP (tempo pace) per week, one LR (long run pace), one track run, and 2-3 easy runs.

  1mi, 5K
    Only for track, the fastest speed sustainable for that distance.

    It seems that regardless of distance, the ability to "lock in" a pace is quite important.

  Easy run
    Easy run would mean as fast as one can easily converse and relax. It can be 1-2 minutes slower than goal pace and is good for recovery.

  LR
    LR can be 1-2 minutes slower than goal pace. Some LR will also include MP (goal pace) for a few miles. Compared to easy run, LR should focus on build endurance.

    In CARA training plan, the LR distance is not always increasing, but would have a week of scale back after every two weeks of increase. The total weekly distance can grow from 40mi to 70mi, including 22mi long runs for Advanced II groups.

  TP
    Tempo pace means a little faster than goal pace, on the other hand reduce the distance compared to an easy run.

Yasso format
  Predict marathon time with 800m repetitions. Each repetition should take the same time. Runner should strive for the fastest pace that is sustainable, so the first repetition should not be too fast. In one CARA training, the time for group II was 3:15 and rest time was 2:40, for 10 repetitions; the time was quite consistent (+/- 10s)
