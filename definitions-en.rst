Marathon
  26.22mi or 42.195km. A dumb runner would say "I just finished my 5K marathon," but that is a misuse of the term.

Pace
  There are two ways to represent pace: the minutes per mile, or the reciprocal, the miles per hour. Unlike MPG (miles per gallon), where the fuel efficiency can be directly compared, many people prefer the minutes per mile measure. A treadmill usually allows the runner to choose between them.

  In CARA training plan, there are several different types of runs, and the pace of each is related to the goal pace. Runners have very different understanding to pace terms due to individual goals and conditions. Weather (temperature, humidity, wind, rain or snow) can severely affect performance. Thus when looking at the pace number for a certain run, one has to combine all the information to understand what type of run it is. Typically there is one TP (tempo pace) per week, one LR (long run pace), one track run, and 2-3 easy runs.

  1mi, 5K
    Only for track, the fastest speed sustainable for that distance.

    It seems that regardless of distance, the ability to "lock in" a pace is quite important.

  Easy run
    Easy run would mean as fast as one can easily converse and relax. It can be 1-2 minutes slower than goal pace and is good for recovery.

  LR
    LR can be 1-2 minutes slower than goal pace. Some LR will also include MP (goal pace) for a few miles. Compared to easy run, LR should focus on build endurance.

    In CARA training plan, the LR distance is not always increasing, but would have a week of scale back after every two weeks of increase. The total weekly distance can grow from 40mi to 70mi, including 22mi long runs for Advanced II groups.

  TP
    Tempo pace means a little faster than goal pace, on the other hand reduce the distance compared to an easy run.

Running injury
  Discomfort from running.

  Runners knee
    The first symptom of discomfort when increasing the distance. Typically one develops knee pain after 5-8 miles, and it would become tolerable (with the help of strength training, posture adjustment, proper shoes, leggings.) It would never go away but quite mild when other symptom come up with longer distances.

  Plantar fasciitis
    The foot pain that is the worst in the morning. Strength training, specialized stretching/compression socks may help relieve the symptom.

  Achilles heel
    The symptom of sharp pain, sometimes a nodule can be felt in the tendon. When the body is not warmed up, running too fast would injure the tendon. Soft surface (sand or grass) would also cause tendon to repetitively stretch. Stretching before and after running is very important for tendon to get used to the heavy load.

  Collapsed arch
    For flat earthers, who has a flexible foot or weak arch, running may cause tendon to repetitively stretch. Tightly tied shoes may force the arch to collapse (? citation needed.) Supportive shoes can help both people with flat foot, as well as people with high arch (? citation needed.) As "supportive" is just an one-dimension metric, while foot may overpronate/underpronate on two directions, while shoes can provide support in all 3-dimensions (? citation needed.) The only concern for perfect shoes would be that at different speed (proportional to the force on the weight bearing foot, and how tired the tendon is), it may need different amount of correction. A shape-shifting pair of shoes might be possible (? citation needed.)

    Flat earthlings are quite sensitive to shoes. When shoes run out of its useful life, the support and the comfort would be gone. When the rubber layer on the outer sole is depleted, and the foam layer gets compressed over and over and no longer bounce back in time, do not ignore pains. A pair of new shoes may take weeks to burn in like headphones do (? citation needed.)

  Shin splints
    Or tibial splints, the discomfort that may develop after reaching 30-40mi. Similar to runners knee, it can become tolerable with the help of strength training, stretching, posture adjustment, compression. Both long run and track run can still achieve goal pace. There is certain risk of stress fracture.

  Runners toe
    The symptom of bloody blisters under toenail. It may develop after just one run when the shoes are too small or the socks are too thick. When the socks are pressed against the toe-box, it lost its ability to absorb impacts.

    Runners also get fungal infection. Always blow the toenails and slippers dry after a bath. After each run, spray shoes with Lysol promptly.

  Corn
    Maybe switch to cycling for a few months?

  Joint pain
    Could happen for ultra marathoners (? citation needed.)

  Cramps
    Not drinking enough water and electrolyte, or had too much beer (which can cause dehydration.)

  Diarrhea
    Possible causes are milk for lactose intolerance, and zero-sugar sports drinks' sweeteners for some people. High fiber food may also cause discomfort. On the other hand, if re-hydration is not a problem, diarrhea is better than constipation before running.

  Headache
    Heat or dehydration. In either case, fluid with electrolyte could help.

    To make up for the sweat loss, one should drink electrolyte before, during, and after a race.

Yasso format
  Predict marathon time with 800m repetitions. Each repetition should take the same time. Runner should strive for the fastest pace that is sustainable, so the first repetition should not be too fast. In one CARA training, the time for group II was 3:15 and rest time was 2:40, for 10 repetitions; the time was quite consistent (+/- 10s)
